# CMS Manager

To run the demo, open [https://andymina.github.io/CMS-Manager/] in your browser which represents the client's site. Then in another tab open [https://andymina.github.io/CMS-Manager/edit] which is is the actual CMS (*Content Management System*).

You can change the content by modifying the values in the textbox on the edit site. This project uses Google's Firebase to store content data, such as images and content. You can change the background image, the header text, and the tagline. My goal is to make it so you can change CSS properties such as color.
